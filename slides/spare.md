[37](# "ref")
On the last day of the **feast**, the great day, <br>
Jesus stood up and **cried** out,

“If anyone **thirsts**, <br>
let him **come** to me and drink.

[38](# "ref")
Whoever **believes** in me <br>
as the Scripture has said, <br>
Out of his heart will flow rivers of **living water**.”

[John 7:37-38 (ESV) (p.1/2)](# "ref")

[39](# "ref")
Now this he said about the **Spirit**, <br>
whom those who believed in him <br>
were to receive,

for as yet the Spirit had **not** been given, <br>
because Jesus was not yet **glorified**.

[John 7:39 (ESV) (p.2/2)](# "ref")

*37*  Ἐν δὲ τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ μεγάλῃ τῆς **ἑορτῆς** <br>
εἱστήκει ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ **ἔκραξεν** λέγων,

 Ἐάν τις **διψᾷ** **ἐρχέσθω** πρός με καὶ **πινέτω**. 

*38* ὁ **πιστεύων** εἰς ἐμέ, καθὼς εἶπεν ἡ **γραφή**,<br>
**ποταμοὶ** ἐκ τῆς **κοιλίας** αὐτοῦ <br>
ῥεύσουσιν **ὕδατος ζῶντος**.

*39* τοῦτο δὲ εἶπεν περὶ τοῦ **πνεύματος** <br>
ὃ ἔμελλον λαμβάνειν οἱ **πιστεύσαντες** εἰς αὐτόν· 

οὔπω γὰρ ἦν πνεῦμα, ὅτι Ἰησοῦς οὐδέπω **ἐδοξάσθη**.
