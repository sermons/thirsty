On the last day of the **feast**, the great day, <br>
Jesus stood up and **cried** out, 

“If anyone **thirsts**, <br>
let him **come** to me and drink.

Whoever **believes** in me, <br>
as the Scripture has said, <br>
Out of his heart will flow rivers of **living water**.’”

Now this he said about the **Spirit**, <br>
whom those who believed in him <br>
were to receive, 

for as yet the Spirit had **not** been given, <br>
because Jesus was not yet **glorified**.
