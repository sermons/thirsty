**trusting** in myself instead of trusting **You**.

I commit to **read** Your Word and **follow** it -- <br>
to **walk** humbly in Your ways.

Grant me the **Holy Spirit** to guide me, <br>
And give me a **new life** -- Your eternal life.

That they also may **trust** in You.

This I pray, in the name of **Jesus Christ**, <br>
Amen.
