each of us has turned to our **own way**;

and the Lord has laid on him <br>
the **iniquity** of us all.

After he has **suffered**, <br>
he will see the **light of life** and be satisfied;

by his knowledge my righteous servant <br>
will **justify** many, <br>
and he will **bear** their iniquities.

# Q3

---
Lord **Jesus Christ**, thank You for loving me. <br>
You are the **Creator** God, and <br>
You came **down** from heaven to show Your **love**.

You **died** for my sins upon the cross: <br>
You paid the **penalty** to remove my guilt.

You **rose** from the dead on the third day -- <br>
You **triumphed** over sin and death!

[Prayer of Commitment (p.1/3)](# "ref")

---
Lord Jesus, I want to **follow** You. <br>
Please live in my **heart** <br>
and take **control** of my life.

I **repent** of my sin -- the sin of <br>
**trusting** in myself instead of trusting **You**.

I commit to **read** Your Word and **follow** it -- <br>
to **walk** humbly in Your ways.

[Prayer of Commitment (p.2/3)](# "ref")

---
Grant me the **Holy Spirit** to guide me, <br>
And give me a **new life** -- Your eternal life.

**Heal** my heart and fill it with Your **love**; <br>
Bless my **loved ones**, too, <br>
That they also may **trust** in You.

This I pray, in the name of **Jesus Christ**, <br>
Amen.
